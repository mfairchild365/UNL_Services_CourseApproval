This project provides a simple API for the course data within the creq system
built by Tim Steiner.

This project requires the UNL_Autoload package, and optionally Cache_Lite for
caching data from the creq system.

Currently data is cached on the local system in /tmp/cache_* files and stored
for one week.

See the docs/examples/ directory for examples.
